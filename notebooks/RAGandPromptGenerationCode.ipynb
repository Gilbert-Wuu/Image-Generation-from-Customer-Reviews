It has a 27-inch 4K UHD IPS \\ndisplay that provides breathtaking clarity and vibrant colors. The ultra-thin bezel \\ndesign provides an immersive viewing experience. Enjoy tear-free gameplay and \\nsmooth visuals with AMD FreeSync technology. With HDMI and DisplayPort \\nchoices, you can easily connect. This feature-rich display for work or play will \\nenhance your visual experience. \\n \\nReviews: \\n● I have two Dell 27 inch monitors. This one was my second purchase. It's easy to set \\nup. It has a sturdy build. Excellent connectivity and the additional USB ports and \\nsound port make it a perfect addition to my desktop. Color is accurate, picture quality \\nis bright and clear. Use both dell monitors on a Mini-PC primarily as a photo editing \\nplatform, but the 4k allows me to work with high quality video as well. I have no \\ncomplaints. I would buy this again if I needed to.\",\n"," '● \\nDell has become my go to for monitors. The build quality is always high, the picture is \\nclear and it works well. I have this monitor setup with an Anker USB-C dock hooked \\nup to an M1 MacBook Air. No, it cannot do multiple external monitors, but a single \\nlarge monitor is what my wife had with her old iMac 27\" and this monitor does not \\ndisappoint. No, it\\'s not the highest in any spec, but it\\'s a solid choice for standard \\nproductivity tasks like documents and some media work like photos and videos. The \\nquality and functionality represents a good value for the money. \\n● \\nThis monitor is superb; more than a bargain at the price I paid for it ($243.79, \\nincluding shipping). The default setting of 75 for brightness is extremely powerful; I \\nturned it down to 50 and it\\'s still quite bright. The resolution is incredibly sharp and \\ncolors are true and accurate. The anti-glare coating is very effective. It\\'s hard to find \\na flaw here, but if I were to mention one, this monitor does NOT support USB-C / \\nThunderbolt. Your connectivity is limited to HDMI and DisplayPort. \\n● \\nIm a photographer who is frustrated editing on this monitor because it is not color-\\ncalibrated. It doesn\\'t even have a color-accurate mode, even my brother\\'s cheaper \\ngaming monitor has a color-accurate mode. This issue isn\\'t why I\\'m giving the \\nmonitor 2 stars however, I should have done the research I just saw it had 99% color \\ngamut and thought it would suffice. The reason for the 2 stars is the constant issues \\nthe monitor is having. From causing my laptop to not start up correctly, to randomly \\ndisconnecting the monitor is always frustrating to deal with. I have to have it \\ndisconnected when I turn on my laptop because if it\\'s connected my laptop doesn\\'t \\nboot up correctly and gives me the BSOD, sometimes it disconnects, and unplugging \\nand plugging it back in won\\'t fix the issue I have to restart my laptop for it to work \\ncorrectly again. I regret buying it, especially for the +$300 price tag at the time. I \\nwould have been better off with another monitor. \\n● \\nThis would be a great monitor but i has trouble with my M1 (Silicon) MacBook Pro. \\nThe display flickers when certain images/colors/brightness are on screen. Google it \\nand you will see a ton of M series MacBook users with this problem, with no solution \\nfrom Dell or Apple, and Dell says officially they do not support Mac at all. I had zero \\nproblems with it and my older Intel-based Mac Pro (booting into Mac OS or \\nWindows). But the flicker occurs when using the M1 MacBook with no real solution \\nanywhere except \"it\\'s not compatible\" \\n● \\nThe monitor was great for the first few months and then suddenly started flashing \\nafter i not using it for 10 days.I  got an immediate response from customer service to \\nhave the unit replaced. However, they sent me a refurbished monitor that arrived \\nbroken. All in all just a waste of time for me. Its cheap but just not worth the hassle. \\nSpend a little more for peace of mind.  Also, the picture quality isn\\'t the best. You can \\npick out pixels in the display \\n● \\nFirst off, I really do like this monitor, now that I have gotten it tweaked in for my use. \\nIt is actually a simple, straight forward machine, if only they had included even \\nrudimentary instructions in the box, which is the reason for giving it only 4 stars, \\nwhen it deserves 5 stars...The pictorial instructions got me hooked right up, but I \\nalmost returned it, because I could not figure out how to turn it on!!! After about 35 \\nminutes of frustration, including online research, I ran my fingers all along the bottom \\nand top of the machine, and felt a little bump at the bottom right, and luckily turned it \\non. There is no icon to tell you this switch exists, and the instructions show a picture',\n"," 'of the power button where the headphone jack is!! ... I am using this monitor for my \\ndigital audio recording workstation, with a Mac M4 Pro computer. The screen was too \\nbright for my tastes, but my Mac had some screen adjustments which allowed me to \\nwarm the screen up, but then everything looked kind of yellow, which was not \\nsatisfying either. Again, I searched the bottom of the machine, thinking that there \\nHAD to be some kind of adjustment to lower the brightness, and I felt 3 little bumps, \\nnear the elusive power switch, but I thought they were just part of the trim, and that \\nno one would make a machine with such inconvenient controls.. but no, they were \\nadjustment buttons!! I only found these after a few days of frustration, all of which \\nwas needless, if instructions had been included... Anyway, at this point, I am totally \\nhappy with this monitor- very crisp, sharp, pleasant picture, now that I have lowered \\nthe brightness.. I love the fact that almost the entire screen is the picture, with a \\nborder that is about 3/8\" at the top and sides, and about 3/4\" at the bottom. I got this \\non sale for $213.00, and for that price it was a bargain, but the current $279.00 price \\nis still probably worth it, I think. It serves my needs perfectly. \\n● \\nThis is a decent monitor that was on sale when I needed a new wide screen monitor. \\nLooking back though, I would have bought something else since it makes my multiple \\nmonitor set up a bit weird due to differences in physical sizes and resolutions. Since \\nthis has the same resolution as the smaller monitors I already owned but is physically \\nbigger, it ends up with everything on this monitor looking larger than it does on all my \\nother monitors. This was always going to be a second wide screen monitor and I \\nbought a bigger/nicer widescreen monitor that has a much higher resolution since I \\nbought this one. That new one doesn\\'t have this issue so I can move things just fine \\nbetween my older monitors and that one without them being a noticeably different \\nsize. I refer to this one as my old man monitor now, good for quickly blowing things \\nup to a larger size but not so much for multitasking using multiple windows on one \\nmonitor like the newer monitor I bought. In a four monitor set up with two very old \\nmonitors to be replaced before this one it will still get plenty of use though. \\n● \\nI\\'m really happy with the quality of the images, especially when viewed from various \\nangles other than head-on. I knew that the sound system was not great, but not \\nexpecting that even with all possible interventions in Windows and on the monitor \\nitself that I began to wonder if I should also buy a pair of hearing aids. CONTRARY \\nto many reviews that wrote disparagingly about the so-called wobbly stand, I found it \\nwobbly only before I noticed on the provided set-up sheet of instructions that it was \\nnecessary to tighten the connection between the base and the post holding the \\nmonitor itself by tightening the screw that is factory installed for this purpose. Tighten \\nthat screw and the post is absolutely rigid. \\n● \\ni had bought this for my son\\'s birthday. here are my comments: \\n- the screen is an LCD. i know that i wasn\\'t going to get a big fancy OLED this size \\nfor under a thousand dollars, but i feel like the manufacurer had deliberately avoided \\nmentioning the screen type. however, the color quality and visual quality are much \\nbetter than my previous setup (a 41 inch 30hz LCD samsung smart TV). \\n-the volume is probably the best thing about this: loud sounds are hushed down and \\nbackground sounds are very easy to hear, ideal for horror or stealth games. i actually \\nhave the volume at 1% because xbox doesn\\'t seem to have a native volume control, \\nso i\\'m sure the speakers could be deafening if you wanted.',\n"," '-the curved screen makes it easier to sit closer to the screen without hurting your \\neyes, and while the colors don\\'t go very dark, lighter off-whites are very easy to spot. \\ni can\\'t wait to use this for digital drawing. \\nassembly also just involved clicking together a two-piece stand and inserting cables. \\nthe monitor even moves a bit to make cable insertion easier. \\nbut my favorite thing is that this product is \"dumb\", it doesn\\'t have any eavesdropping \\nvirtual assistants, unneeded internet connectivity, or ads. i bet that it was only $360 \\nbecause dell marketed this as a \"monitor\" rather than a \"home entertainment \\nplatform\", however it still has the quality graphics one would expect from a modern \\nappliance. \\n \\ni am a bit mad at amazon for not putting the product into an anonymous brown box \\nbefore leaving it on my doorstep at 3:30 PM, but i can\\'t blame the seller or \\nmanufacturer for that. \\nActual image:',\n"," 'Product 3: HIGH VISIBILITY INSULATED HI VIS REFLECTIVE \\nROAD WORK SAFETY BOMBER JACKET COAT \\n \\nDescription:  \\nPyramex RJ3210 HIGH VISIBILITY LIME GREEN COAT Hi Vis CLASS 3 Insulated \\nSafety Bomber Reflective Winter Work Jacket With Quilted Liner For ROAD WORK Or \\nConstruction, Sizes: Small - 6XLarge \\nThe RJ3210 by Pyramex is a class 3 weatherproof bomber jacket with a quilted liner and \\nblack bottom.

The build quality is always high, the picture is \\nclear and it works well. I have this monitor setup with an Anker USB-C dock hooked \\nup to an M1 MacBook Air. No, it cannot do multiple external monitors, but a single \\nlarge monitor is what my wife had with her old iMac 27\" and this monitor does not \\ndisappoint. No, it\\'s not the highest in any spec, but it\\'s a solid choice for standard \\nproductivity tasks like documents and some media work like photos and videos. The \\nquality and functionality represents a good value for the money. \\n● \\nThis monitor is superb; more than a bargain at the price I paid for it ($243.79, \\nincluding shipping). The default setting of 75 for brightness is extremely powerful; I \\nturned it down to 50 and it\\'s still quite bright. The resolution is incredibly sharp and \\ncolors are true and accurate. The anti-glare coating is very effective. It\\'s hard to find \\na flaw here, but if I were to mention one, this monitor does NOT support USB-C / \\nThunderbolt. Your connectivity is limited to HDMI and DisplayPort. \\n● \\nIm a photographer who is frustrated editing on this monitor because it is not color-\\ncalibrated. It doesn\\'t even have a color-accurate mode, even my brother\\'s cheaper \\ngaming monitor has a color-accurate mode. This issue isn\\'t why I\\'m giving the \\nmonitor 2 stars however, I should have done the research I just saw it had 99% color \\ngamut and thought it would suffice. The reason for the 2 stars is the constant issues \\nthe monitor is having. From causing my laptop to not start up correctly, to randomly \\ndisconnecting the monitor is always frustrating to deal with. I have to have it \\ndisconnected when I turn on my laptop because if it\\'s connected my laptop doesn\\'t \\nboot up correctly and gives me the BSOD, sometimes it disconnects, and unplugging \\nand plugging it back in won\\'t fix the issue I have to restart my laptop for it to work \\ncorrectly again. I regret buying it, especially for the +$300 price tag at the time. I \\nwould have been better off with another monitor. \\n● \\nThis would be a great monitor but i has trouble with my M1 (Silicon) MacBook Pro. \\nThe display flickers when certain images/colors/brightness are on screen. Google it \\nand you will see a ton of M series MacBook users with this problem, with no solution \\nfrom Dell or Apple, and Dell says officially they do not support Mac at all. I had zero \\nproblems with it and my older Intel-based Mac Pro (booting into Mac OS or \\nWindows). But the flicker occurs when using the M1 MacBook with no real solution \\nanywhere except \"it\\'s not compatible\" \\n● \\nThe monitor was great for the first few months and then suddenly started flashing \\nafter i not using it for 10 days.I  got an immediate response from customer service to \\nhave the unit replaced. However, they sent me a refurbished monitor that arrived \\nbroken. All in all just a waste of time for me. Its cheap but just not worth the hassle. \\nSpend a little more for peace of mind.  Also, the picture quality isn\\'t the best. You can \\npick out pixels in the display \\n● \\nFirst off, I really do like this monitor, now that I have gotten it tweaked in for my use. \\nIt is actually a simple, straight forward machine, if only they had included even \\nrudimentary instructions in the box, which is the reason for giving it only 4 stars, \\nwhen it deserves 5 stars...The pictorial instructions got me hooked right up, but I \\nalmost returned it, because I could not figure out how to turn it on!!! After about 35 \\nminutes of frustration, including online research, I ran my fingers all along the bottom \\nand top of the machine, and felt a little bump at the bottom right, and luckily turned it \\non.

I am using this monitor for my \\ndigital audio recording workstation, with a Mac M4 Pro computer. The screen was too \\nbright for my tastes, but my Mac had some screen adjustments which allowed me to \\nwarm the screen up, but then everything looked kind of yellow, which was not \\nsatisfying either. Again, I searched the bottom of the machine, thinking that there \\nHAD to be some kind of adjustment to lower the brightness, and I felt 3 little bumps, \\nnear the elusive power switch, but I thought they were just part of the trim, and that \\nno one would make a machine with such inconvenient controls.. but no, they were \\nadjustment buttons!! I only found these after a few days of frustration, all of which \\nwas needless, if instructions had been included... Anyway, at this point, I am totally \\nhappy with this monitor- very crisp, sharp, pleasant picture, now that I have lowered \\nthe brightness.. I love the fact that almost the entire screen is the picture, with a \\nborder that is about 3/8\" at the top and sides, and about 3/4\" at the bottom. I got this \\non sale for $213.00, and for that price it was a bargain, but the current $279.00 price \\nis still probably worth it, I think. It serves my needs perfectly. \\n● \\nThis is a decent monitor that was on sale when I needed a new wide screen monitor. \\nLooking back though, I would have bought something else since it makes my multiple \\nmonitor set up a bit weird due to differences in physical sizes and resolutions. Since \\nthis has the same resolution as the smaller monitors I already owned but is physically \\nbigger, it ends up with everything on this monitor looking larger than it does on all my \\nother monitors. This was always going to be a second wide screen monitor and I \\nbought a bigger/nicer widescreen monitor that has a much higher resolution since I \\nbought this one. That new one doesn\\'t have this issue so I can move things just fine \\nbetween my older monitors and that one without them being a noticeably different \\nsize. I refer to this one as my old man monitor now, good for quickly blowing things \\nup to a larger size but not so much for multitasking using multiple windows on one \\nmonitor like the newer monitor I bought. In a four monitor set up with two very old \\nmonitors to be replaced before this one it will still get plenty of use though. \\n● \\nI\\'m really happy with the quality of the images, especially when viewed from various \\nangles other than head-on. I knew that the sound system was not great, but not \\nexpecting that even with all possible interventions in Windows and on the monitor \\nitself that I began to wonder if I should also buy a pair of hearing aids. CONTRARY \\nto many reviews that wrote disparagingly about the so-called wobbly stand, I found it \\nwobbly only before I noticed on the provided set-up sheet of instructions that it was \\nnecessary to tighten the connection between the base and the post holding the \\nmonitor itself by tightening the screw that is factory installed for this purpose. Tighten \\nthat screw and the post is absolutely rigid. \\n● \\ni had bought this for my son\\'s birthday. here are my comments: \\n- the screen is an LCD. i know that i wasn\\'t going to get a big fancy OLED this size \\nfor under a thousand dollars, but i feel like the manufacurer had deliberately avoided \\nmentioning the screen type. however, the color quality and visual quality are much \\nbetter than my previous setup (a 41 inch 30hz LCD samsung smart TV). \\n-the volume is probably the best thing about this: loud sounds are hushed down and \\nbackground sounds are very easy to hear, ideal for horror or stealth games. i actually \\nhave the volume at 1% because xbox doesn\\'t seem to have a native volume control, \\nso i\\'m sure the speakers could be deafening if you wanted.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='[Excerpt from
